## 1. Create Google OAuth Credentials

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project or select existing one
3. Enable Google+ API
4. Go to "Credentials" → "Create Credentials" → "OAuth 2.0 Client IDs"
5. Set application type to "Web application"
6. Add authorized redirect URIs:
   - `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/google` (development)
   - `https://your-domain.com/api/auth/callback/google` (production)

## 2. Environment Variables

```
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-random-secret-here
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-google-client-id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-google-client-secret
